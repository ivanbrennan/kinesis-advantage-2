# Kinesis Advantage 2 (KB600)

The ergonomics of this keyboard are very appealing, but it will probably take me a while to get comfortable on it.
I'll give the default layout a chance before changing anything, but I suspect I'll end up remapping some of the thumb keys.

I use Meta, Control, Escape, and Super a lot (for XMonad, vim, emacs, etc.), and repurposing CapsLock to act as Control when
held or Escape when tapped ([caps2esc](https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/caps2esc)) means I have all four of these
in comfortable positions (Super is a bit of a stretch, but I need it less frequently than the others).

The Kinesis puts Control at a comfortable position on the thumb clusters, but Meta and Super are less accessable and Escape is
a tiny key off in the distance, as usual. I like the conceptual symmetry it has in placing Backspace beneath the left thumb,
mirroring the Space key beneath the right thumb, and with Delete beside it, but I'm not sure it warrants such a valuable piece
of real estate (and I _know_ the Delete key does not).

I had some trepidation about compatibility because I'm running NixOS, but so far it's been plug and play. And so far it seems
to work fine alongside caps2esc and my X keyboard options (e.g. `shift:both_capslock`). It emits an annoying beep when I
press CapsLock, but that appears to be a setting that can be disabled (and probably the first setting I'll change).
